# 🌍 Disaster Management and Real-Time Prediction for Risk Mitigation
**Theme:** Sustainability  
**Domain:** Data Science / Machine Learning / AI  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Natural disasters cause significant damage to life, infrastructure, and the environment. However, current systems lack real-time predictive intelligence, leading to delayed responses and inefficient resource allocation.

### 💥 Challenges We Identified:
- Lack of real-time disaster prediction and alert systems
- Fragmented communication across response teams
- Limited integration of satellite, sensor, and social media data
- Inefficient resource deployment

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We developed an **AI-powered, multi-layered disaster management platform** that enables:

- 🔎 **Early Detection** of disasters via satellite and sensor data  
- ✅ **Verification** using social media analysis to eliminate false positives  
- 📢 **Real-Time Situational Awareness** to guide emergency response teams  
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** for monitoring and decision-making
